    "### Install AdGuard Home\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I installed AGH as a LXC container on my PVE host, using\n",
    "[the script provided here](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/). This approach is\n",
    "easier to maintain, but later I decided to move the installation to my OpenWrt\n",
    "VM. Unlike a physical router, the soft router has effectively unlimited RAM and\n",
    "ROM anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is already an **excellent** tutorial from\n",
    "[OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/dns/adguard-home). You\n",
    "just have to follow it from the beginning to the end, with a couple of things to\n",
    "note.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before installing AGH, I had been giving the OpenWrt VM 256 MB RAM without an\n",
    "   issue. However, when I was configuring AGH through the web portal, the whole\n",
    "   VM crashed a few times when I clicked the \"save\" button. Since the VM just\n",
    "   crashed instantly, I did not get too much information on what happened. I\n",
    "   suspected it was an OOM issue, so I just gave it 284 MB RAM instead, and the\n",
    "   problem never showed up again.\n",
    "2. You do not have to follow the reverse proxy, ipset, and iptables section.\n",
    "3. Following the tutorial, your router itself will not be able to access WAN. To\n",
    "   solve this issue, add a line in your `/etc/adaguardhome.yaml` like this\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yml\n",
    "   dns:\n",
    "     bind_hosts:\n",
    "       - 127.0.0.1\n",
    "       - 192.168.1.1\n",
    "   port: 53\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note the added `192.168.1.1` (or whatever LAN IP address you use for your\n",
    "   router).\n",
    "4. The default data AGH data folder is at `/var/adguardhome` which is not\n",
    "   persist. Query logs and statistics will be lost upon reboot. This is mainly\n",
    "   for the sake of a hardware router where you have a flash ROM, so a lot of\n",
    "   writing to the ROM should be avoided and free space is likely an issue as\n",
    "   well. However, for a soft router, neither is a problem. You can move the data\n",
    "   to a more persist directory, for example, `/opt/adguardhome`. To do so,\n",
    "   simply stop the service\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```shell\n",
