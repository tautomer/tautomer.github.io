Los Alamos and surrounding areas are excellent for star gazing. I often felt sad
when realizing I could not record what saw. This is my main motivation to buy a
camera and start photographing.

At this moment, many people probably have never seen the Milky Way themselves.
If you are one of them, enjoy these photos.
