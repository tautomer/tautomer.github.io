       If you are like me, running
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction/">
        home lab
       </a>
       stuff, but do
not expose these services to the public, you probably have encountered similar
problems as me,
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        SSL certificate warnings show up everywhere,
       </li>
       <li>
        port numbers makes 0 sense and you cannot remember,
       </li>
       <li>
        a bunch of docker containers running on the same host with the only difference
being the port (how do you even distinguish them), etc.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I have been thinking of solving this problem once for all, but to be honest, I
was not very clear what to do exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, I spent some time googling and experimenting around. Finally, I got it
working with
       <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html">
        AdGuard Home
       </a>
       serving as the local DNS server and
       <a href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/">
        Nginx Proxy Manager
       </a>
       as the reverse proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, there has been a ton of tutorials on this online, but I still struggled
a lot when trying to set it up. I think the issue is that unless you know what
to do, you will not even know what/how to google. As a result, I think it is
still meaningful for me to write this whole thing down. As least, it can be a
good reminder on how to replicate this process for myself.

       Due to the fact that I wanted to save as much money as possible when building my
home lab, the whole setup might seem to be dumb and lacking of redundancy.
Redundancy is indeed a big problem for me, but hey, we are not in the production
environment anyway. As long as I do not lose data, it is not unacceptable to
leave with the problems for a few years. I will probably rebuild a better setup
when the current hardware is too old to be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, I use a
       <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">
        Proxmox Virtual Environment
       </a>
       as
the host for almost everything, including

      </ul>
      <p>
       and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal is to get rid of all the SSL certificate warnings for my own servers
and directly access them without the need of a port number. The approach is as
follows.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Get a public domain name. To save money, I use
        <a href="https://www.dynu.com/en-US">
         dynu
        </a>
        's free DDNS service.
       </li>
       <li>
        Use
        <code>
         Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)
        </code>
        to get a certificate for the domain.
       </li>
       <li>
        Use
        <code>
         NPM
        </code>
        to redirect all your servers to a subdomain of the
public domain, for example,
        <code>
         nextcloud.domain.tld
        </code>
        -&gt;
        <code>
         nextcloud.lan:443
        </code>
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        Use
        <code>
         AdGuard Home
        </code>
        as a LAN DNS server to redirect all traffic to
        <code>
         *.domain.tld
        </code>
        to your
        <code>
         NPM
        </code>
        without going through a public DNS resolver.

       Initially, I installed AGH as a LXC container on my PVE host, using
       <a href="https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/">
        the script provided here
       </a>
       . This approach is
easier to maintain, but later I decided to move the installation to my OpenWrt
VM. Unlike a physical router, the soft router has effectively unlimited RAM and
ROM anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is already an
       <strong>
        excellent
       </strong>
       tutorial from
       <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/dns/adguard-home">
        OpenWrt
       </a>
       . You
just have to follow it from the beginning to the end, with a couple of things to
note.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Before installing AGH, I had been giving the OpenWrt VM 256 MB RAM without an
issue. However, when I was configuring AGH through the web portal, the whole
VM crashed a few times when I clicked the "save" button. Since the VM just
crashed instantly, I did not get too much information on what happened. I
suspected it was an OOM issue, so I just gave it 284 MB RAM instead, and the
problem never showed up again.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You do not have to follow the reverse proxy, ipset, and iptables section.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Following the tutorial, your router itself will not be able to access WAN. To
solve this issue, add a line in your
         <code>
          /etc/adaguardhome.yaml
         </code>
         like this
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-yml">yml
dns:
  bind_hosts:
    - 127.0.0.1
    - 192.168.1.1
port: 53
</code></pre>
        <p>
         Note the added
         <code>
          192.168.1.1
         </code>
         (or whatever LAN IP address you use for your
router).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The default data AGH data folder is at
         <code>
          /var/adguardhome
         </code>
         which is not
persist. Query logs and statistics will be lost upon reboot. This is mainly
for the sake of a hardware router where you have a flash ROM, so a lot of
writing to the ROM should be avoided and free space is likely an issue as
well. However, for a soft router, neither is a problem. You can move the data
to a more persist directory, for example,
         <code>
          /opt/adguardhome
         </code>
         . To do so,
simply stop the service
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
         <pre><span></span>service<span class="w"> </span>adguardhome<span class="w"> </span>stop
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
         and copy the data directory
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
         <pre><span></span>cp<span class="w"> </span>/var/adguardhome<span class="w"> </span>/opt
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
         then modify AGH's working directory
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
         <pre><span></span>sed<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'s/var/opt/g'</span><span class="w"> </span>/etc/config/adguardhome
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
         fianlly restart AGH
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
         <pre><span></span>service<span class="w"> </span>adguardhome<span class="w"> </span>start
</pre>
        </div>
       </li>
      </ol>

    </div>

       </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Of course, you can pay for a fancy domain for yourself, but I would like to save
the money for a meal, so I chose
       <a href="https://www.dynu.com/en-US/">
        dynu
       </a>
       . Note that
there are a whole lot free DDNS providers. You may get better experience with
some other DDNS services.
      </p>
      <p>
       To do this, follow these steps.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Register an account, then you will see a page like this
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="Control panel of your account" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/reg.png"/>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Go to
         <code>
          DDNS Services
         </code>
         and choose a host name and a top-level domain (TLD)
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="Choose your domain" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/domain.png"/>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then, in principle, you public IP will directly be filled and you are all
set. Of course, you can play with the options, but the default will work just
fine. However, if you do not have a public IP address or it changes over
time, you need some other tricks to bypass it. I will refer you to Google.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="Success" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/ddns.png"/>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </div>
    </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="jp-Cell jp-MarkdownCell jp-Notebook-cell">
   <div class="jp-Cell-inputWrapper">
    <div class="jp-Collapser jp-InputCollapser jp-Cell-inputCollapser">

       </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Again, you can either use the official
       <a href="https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-setup">
        docker
image
       </a>
       ,
but I chose to use a LXC container. Again, the script is provided by
       <a href="https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/">
        tteck
       </a>
       . Follow the prompt from the
script and every thing should be fine. Just note that you can have your port 80
and 443 open to get certified, but with the
       <code>
        DNS challenge
       </code>
       way, you do not have
to. If you are planning to or already exposed your services to WAN, your port is
open anyway. However, if you are like me who do not want to deal with the
outside world, the
       <code>
        DNS challenge
       </code>
       way is way better.
      </p>
      <p>
       To do it, you might have to install Python packages first. The tool bundled in
NPM to get certificate is the popular
       <code>
        certbot
       </code>
       . As far as I know, supported DNS
providers bundled with it are limited. Others are supported through 3rd party
packages, like
       <code>
        dynu
       </code>
       . I will use
       <code>
        dynu
       </code>
       as an example.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Log in to the LXC container by
        <code>
         ssh
        </code>
        or
        <code>
         lxc-attach
        </code>
        from PVE.
       </li>
       <li>
        Install
        <code>
         certbot-dns-dynu
        </code>
        via
        <code>
         pip install certbot-dns-dynu
        </code>
        .

       Then go back to NPM's web portal and head to the "SSL Certificates" tab. Then
click
       <code>
        Add SSL Certificate
       </code>
       and choose
       <code>
        Let's Encrypt

       <img alt="Add SSL Certificate" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/add_ssl.png"/>

       Next type your domain name, email (if not the one you use for NPM management)
and tic

      <p>
       A few things to note.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I used a
         <strong>
          wildcard
         </strong>
         in the
         <code>
          Domain Names
         </code>
         box, such that the certificate
will work on any subdomains under the domain name. You can, of course, type
several domain names manually.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Choose your DNS provider and obtain a token from there and paste in the
         <code>
          Credentials File Content
         </code>
         box.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="API Credentials" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/api1.png"/>
         <img alt="Generate a new API token" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/api2.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         Paste generated token after
         <code>
          dns_dynu_auth_token=
         </code>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The default
         <code>
          propagation seconds
         </code>
         from the package can be too small. As such,
it is wise to fill in something bigger, for example, 120 seconds.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Then click
       <code>
        Save
       </code>
       . Wait for a couple seconds and you should get a valid
certificate for
       <code>
        *.domain.tld
       </code>
       which is good for 3 months.
       <code>
        certbot
       </code>
       should be
able to auto-renew the certificate, but I am not exactly sure at this moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everything is fine, you should see something like the snapshot below.

      <p>
       Next we want to assign a human-friendly subdomain name to our services.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Click
         <code>
          Host
         </code>
         &gt;
         <code>
          Proxy Hosts
         </code>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="Create a new proxy host" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/hosts.png"/>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         From there, click
         <code>
          Add Proxy Host
         </code>
         on the top right corner of the UI.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In ths dialog, fill in necessary information.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="Assign domain and server" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/host1.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, I will have
         <code>
          nextcloud.domain.tld
         </code>
         as my subdomain for the
Nextcloud server.
         <code>
          Forward Hostname
         </code>
         and
         <code>
          Forward Port
         </code>
         will be whatever
value for you Nextcloud installation. The options below are all optional. You
can experiment with them, but I did see people mentioning that enabling
websockets could help the loading time with your server. For
         <code>
          Access List
         </code>
         ,
sine we are not exposing the server to the public, it does not really matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         <img alt="Assign domain and server" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/host2.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
         In this tab, choose the certificate we just created in the dropdown list. Be
careful with the
         <code>
          Force SSL
         </code>
         option. For servers that are strictly
non-encrypted (only listen to port 80), checking this option will probably
cause problems. For the rest, again, they should help with security or
loading time in principle.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Then we are done with the reverse proxy part. However, at this moment, if you
check the DNS resolution for the subdomain,
       <code>
        nextcloud.domain.tld
       </code>
       , you will
find that your computer will try to reach your public IP. You can do this with
       <code>
        nslookup domain.tld
       </code>
       . You will see your public IP, which means that without
opening a port on your router's firewall, you will not be able to access
Nextcloud. This is where AGH kicks in.

       If you have followed everything in
       <a href="#install-adguard-home">
        installing AGH
       </a>
       , AGH should already be your local DNS
server. To make your public domain work on you local network, one last thing
needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to your AGH web portal and find
       <code>
        DNS rewrites
       </code>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="DNS rewrites" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/dns.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       From there,
       <code>
        Add DNS rewrites
       </code>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="Redirect all traffic to the public domain to NPM" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/dns.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first box, fill in the domain name with a wildcard. Then in the second
box, fill in the hostname or IP of your NPM installation. After you hit
       <code>
        Save
       </code>
       ,
go to you browser, you should be able to access your Nextcloud from the public
domain without a certificate warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="Success!" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/nc.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       <code>
        nslookup
       </code>
       should return your local DNS and server IP.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="nslookup results" src="../../images/homelab/ssl/nslookup.png"/>

       So now, you can do the same thing for everything else, like
       <code>
        op.domain.tld
       </code>
       for
your router,
       <code>
        agh.domain.tld
       </code>
       for your AGH, etc. All your services can be
accessed from this public domain.
