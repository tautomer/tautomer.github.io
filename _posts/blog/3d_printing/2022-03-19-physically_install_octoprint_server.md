# (Physically) install my OctoPrint server

At the time when I got my Voxelab Aquila X2 printer, I kept it in the corner of
a desk against the walls. After using the printer for a few month, I feel it it
necessary to hook it up with an OctoPrint server for easier and more advanced
controls. I happen to have a spare [ASRock N3050M Motherboard][N3050] featuring
an Intel Celeron N3050 CPU, which is perfect for this use case (low power and
relatively low demanding). Even better
