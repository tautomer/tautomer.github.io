Hi, welcome to my blog. I would like to use this blog to share some thoughts on
software development, machine learning, computational chemistry, and my hobbies,
such as homelab, 3D printing, photography, and maybe games (?). Believe it or
not, I was top 5% cruiser player on the whole North America server of World of
Warships.

### About me

I am theoretical chemist trying to understand chemical reactions through
molecular dynamics. Currently, I working on building a deep neural network
framework for predicting excited state properties. Before joining LANL as a
postdoc, I did my PhD at University of Rochester.
