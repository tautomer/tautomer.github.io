Hi, welcome to my blog. I would like to use this blog to share some thoughts on
software development, machine learning, computational chemistry, and my hobbies,
such as homelab, 3D printing, photography, and maybe games (?).

### About the username "tautomer"

It was the end of 2015 (or beginning of 2016). I was about to register an
account for an online game the World of Warships (WoWS). I had a hard time to
pick a username. Suddenly, I noticed the paper I was reading, which was sitting
just by my right hand. The title of the paper was ["Enol Tautomers of Watson−Crick Base Pair Models Are Metastable Because of Nuclear Quantum Effects"][tautomer_paper].
Since then, I have been using this username in many different places.

### About me

I am theoretical chemist trying to understand chemical reactions through
molecular dynamics simulations. Currently, I am working on building a deep
neural network framework for predicting excited state properties. Before joining
LANL as a postdoc, I did my PhD at University of Rochester.

#### Skills

* Software development
* Scientific machine learning
* Molecular dynamics
* Quantum chemistry
* High-performance computing

#### Work experience

* Postdoc, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory. Jan 2022 - now
* Research assistant, Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester. Jan 2016
  \- Dec 2021

#### Education

* University of Rochester, Ph.D. in theoretical chemistry, Dec. 2021
* Wuhan University, B.S. in chemistry, Jul. 2014
